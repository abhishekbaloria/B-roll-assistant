 #  B-Roll Assistant

A simple and beginner-friendly video helper app built using Streamlit.  
The idea? Help content creators (like me) quickly find high-quality b-rolls based on the mood, theme, and style of their video.

This project was created as part of my first-semester coursework — combining basic Python skills with real-world creativity.

##  What It Does

- Lets you pick from 4 main video types:
  - **Fitness** (e.g., gym clips)
  - **Travel** (nature & city shots)
  - **Cooking** (healthy & fast food)
  - **Tech** (programming or setup)
  
- Each category includes multiple subtopics
- Click a button to preview a **random video**
- Save your favorite clips
- Get **custom suggestions** by answering a few simple questions (like your video's purpose, vibe, or setting)
- Submit feedback — it gets stored in a local file called `feedback.txt`
